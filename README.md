# HomeAway

A web application developed using JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, MySQL, MongoDB, Kafka message queue etc.

**Lab1** : The first part of the project where I developed the frontend pages, backend code and the database was in MySQL

**Lab2** : The second part of the project where the database was shifted to MongoDB, adding some functionalities like messaging between owner and traveler, filtering etc, integrating kafka messaging queue to increase the performance and scalability of the application, hosting the whole application on AWS with a highly distributed and scalable architecture which included load balancers and multiple EC2 instances.

**Lab3** : Converting the whole application from REST to GraphQL and writing relevant queries and mutations.
